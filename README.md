# These Images are Makin' me Surly!
## A talk about images
by [Jeremy Wagner](https://jeremywagner.me) ([@malchata](https://twitter.com/malchata))

Using images on the web seems easy, right? Slap 'em in tags, put 'em in `background` properties and it's gold! Gold! Right? Wrong! There's much more to mulva over. You have to think about formats, exporting, sizes, optimization, and yada yada yada. In this session, we'll cover some must-know techniques and information about using images on the web, from realizing the truth about image quality to the foundation of basic image handling and some very refreshing exporting techniques, going further with optimizers (including automation!) and some of the miscellaneous bits and pieces you may not have even known about in this surprisingly deep topic. Show up for serenity now, or it could be insanity later!
