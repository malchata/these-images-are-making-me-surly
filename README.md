# Speed vs. Speed to Market
## A talk about approaching web performance proactively.
by [Jeremy Wagner](https://jeremywagner.me) ([@malchata](https://twitter.com/malchata))

Yet another one of my talks, except this one is on web performance, and what you can do to be a performance advocate before sites get into prod (as well as some tips for slow sites in prod).

If you want to run this talk locally, just clone this repo, `cd` into its directory, and run `npm install` to install dependencies. Then spin up the local web server by typing `node http.js` and point your browser to http://localhost:8080
